## Brazilian Carrot Cake

A traditional favorite in my family, Brazilian carrot cake is very different from the American version. The popular cake is topped with homemade chocolate frosting, and perfect to serve with a glass of milk or tea.

### Ingredients

- 4 large carrots, peeled and thinly slices
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup cooking oil
- 2 cups white sugar
- 2 cups all-purpose white flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 2 tablespoons butter or margarine
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup instant hot chocolate mix
- 3/4 cup milk

### Directions

#### Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 9x12 baking dish.

#### Step 2

Place the carrots, eggs, and oil in a blender or bowl of a food processor. Process until carrots are finely chopped. Pour the carrot mixture into a mixing bowl. Stir in 2 cups sugar until well blended. Stir in the flour and baking powder; mix until well blended. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.

#### Step 3

Bake in preheated oven until top springs back when lightly touched, about 40 minutes.

#### Step 4

Meanwhile, make the icing by placing the butter, 1 cup sugar, instant hot chocolate drink mix, and milk in a pan. While stirring, heat to almost boiling over medium-high heat until mixture thickens. When the cake is done, remove from the oven and immediately spread the icing evenly over the top.
